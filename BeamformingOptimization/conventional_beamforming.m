function snr_values = conventional_beamforming(features)
    % Assume fixed/predefined beam directions
    % You can replace this logic with any conventional algorithm (e.g., MRT)

    % Simulate SNR values as the sum of features or other logic
    snr_values = sum(features, 2);  % Example placeholder
